# Developer Guide

This guide contains all the information developers need to work with the HieraChain framework.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13

### Quick Start

- Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .  # Development mode
    pip install .     # Production mode
    ```

This will set up your environment to work with the framework.

## Running server

```bash
python -m hierachain.api.server
```

---

## Using the package

After installation, you can import components from the package:

```python
from hierachain.core.block import Block
from hierachain.core.blockchain import Blockchain
```

---

## Running Demos

- Run the main framework demonstration:

    ```bash
    python demo/demo.py
    ```

- Run the key backup and recovery demonstration:

    ```bash
    python demo/demo_key_backup.py
    ```

- Run the API demo:

    ```bash
    python demo/demo_api.py
    ```

## Running Tests

> **WARNING**: Running all tests simultaneously may cause failures due to resource constraints. It is recommended to run tests per test file instead of grouping them by directories to ensure more accurate and reliable results.

- To run all unit tests:

    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/unit -v
    ```

- To run all integration tests:

    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/integration -v
    ```

- To run all scenario tests:
    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests/scenarios -v
    ```

- To run only benchmark tests:

    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests --benchmark-only -v --benchmark-save=benchmark_report
    python -m pytest tests --benchmark-only -v --benchmark-histogram=benchmark_report
    ```

- To run all tests:

    ```bash
    python -m pytest tests -v
    ```

---

## Static Analysis

- To run static code analysis:

    ```bash
    python -m scripts.static_analysis
    ```

- To run static code analysis with text output:

    ```bash
    python -m scripts.static_analysis --format text
    ```

- To run static code analysis and save results to a file:

    ```bash
    python -m scripts.static_analysis --output analysis_report.json
    python -m scripts.static_analysis --format text --output analysis_report.txt
    ```
