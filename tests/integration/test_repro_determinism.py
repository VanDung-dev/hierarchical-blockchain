"""
Test deterministic behavior of the OrderingService.

The test checks if the OrderingService is deterministic.
It does this by running the service twice with the same data directory.
The first run sends 3 events, each with a delay to force a new block.
The second run recovers from the journal and checks if it produces the same blocks.
If the service is deterministic, it should produce the same blocks.
If the service is not deterministic, it should produce different blocks.
