# Architecture Overview

## Purpose

HieraChain uses a hierarchy. The Main Chain is the root authority and keeps only proofs from Sub-Chains. Sub-Chains handle business data (events) for each domain. This page describes what each component does and how the main flows work.

## Architecture & Concepts

```mermaid
graph BT
    Main[Main Chain - Supervisor]
    subgraph SubChains [Domain Sub-Chains]
        SC_A[Sub-Chain A - Domain A]
        SC_B[Sub-Chain B - Domain B]
        SC_C[Sub-Chain C - Domain C]
    end
    
    SC_A -->|Submit Proof| Main
    SC_B -->|Submit Proof| Main
    SC_C -->|Submit Proof| Main
```

* Sub-Chains record domain events, order them into blocks, and keep their own world state.
* The Main Chain does not keep detailed domain data. It keeps only cryptographic proofs, which provide system-wide integrity.
* HierarchyManager handles Sub-Chain creation and registration, proof submission, and other multi-chain tasks.

### Key Components

* `hierachain/hierarchical/main_chain/base.py` is the Main Chain. It stores and verifies proofs from Sub-Chains and aggregates integrity reports.
* `hierachain/hierarchical/sub_chain/base.py` is the Sub-Chain. It records domain events, orders them into blocks, generates proofs and sends them to the Main Chain.
* `hierachain/hierarchical/hierarchy_manager/base.py` is the HierarchyManager. It coordinates the multi-chain system, manages the Sub-Chain lifecycle, handles automatic proof submission and cross-chain verification.
* `hierachain/api/storage/ipfs_client.py` provides off-chain IPFS storage. It keeps large or sensitive business data off chain and anchors only the CID on the blockchain.
* `hierachain/consensus/ordering/service.py` is the Ordering Service. It orders events before block creation and is initialized by the Sub-Chain.

### Typical Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Event as Event Source
    participant Sub as Sub-Chain
    participant Order as Ordering Service
    participant Main as Main Chain
    
    Event->>Sub: Record event (add_event)
    Sub->>Order: Order events
    Order-->>Sub: Ordered events
    Sub->>Sub: Package Block (finalize_block)
    Sub->>Main: Submit Proof (submit_proof_to_main)
    Main->>Main: Verify & Store Proof
    Main-->>Sub: Acknowledge
```

1. Record event and create block on the Sub-Chain. `SubChain.add_event()` receives the event and passes it through internal ordering. Events are batched into a block and `finalize_block()` runs when conditions are met.
2. Submit proof to the Main Chain. `SubChain.submit_proof_to_main()` generates a proof from the Merkle root or block hash and calls `MainChain.add_proof()` to anchor it.
3. Global reporting. The Main Chain aggregates results from `get_main_chain_stats()` and per Sub-Chain statistics.
4. System coordination. `HierarchyManager` handles periodic proof submission with `configure_auto_proof_submission`, plus synchronization and cross-chain consistency checks.
