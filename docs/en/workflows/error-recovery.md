# Error mitigation and recovery

## Overview

HieraChain has layered recovery for three areas: network resilience, consensus leader recovery and state rollback. These run independently and can be active at the same time.

---

## 6A: Network recovery

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    NET["🌐 Network Issue Detected"]
    LAT["📊 Collect Latency History"]
    ADJ["⏱️ adjust_timeout()\nRecalculate based on avg + max latency"]
    RED["📡 send_with_redundancy()\nSend via N parallel paths simultaneously"]
    FIRST["✅ First successful response wins"]
    PART["⚠️ Partition Detected?\navg_latency > 5000ms"]
    VC["🔄 _initiate_view_change()\nTrigger BFT view change"]

    NET --> LAT --> ADJ --> RED --> FIRST
    RED --> PART
    PART -->|Yes| VC
    PART -->|No| FIRST
```

`send_with_redundancy()` sends the same message over N parallel paths at once. The first successful response wins and the remaining in flight calls are cancelled. This hides intermittent path failures without explicit retries.

## 6B: Consensus recovery (leader failure)

```mermaid

    participant CRE as 🔧 ConsensusRecoveryEngine
    participant VM as 🔄 BFTViewChangeManager
    participant NEW as 👑 New Leader

    Note over CRE: Leader timeout detected
    CRE->>CRE: handle_leader_failure(failed_leader_id, current_view)
    CRE->>CRE: Check recovery_attempts < max (default 3)
    CRE->>VM: _initiate_view_change(failed_leader, new_view = view + 1)
    VM->>VM: Broadcast VIEW-CHANGE to all validators
    VM->>NEW: Elect new leader: Validators[new_view % n]
    NEW->>NEW: Restart PRE-PREPARE phase
    CRE->>CRE: Clear recovery_attempts on success
```

## 6C: State rollback

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ERR["❌ Critical Error\nor Integrity Failure"]
    SNAP["📸 Load Snapshot\n(RollbackManager)"]
    JRNL["📓 Replay Journal\n(EventJournal)"]
    VER["🔍 Validate Restored State\n(DataValidator)"]
    OK["✅ State Restored"]
    ALERT["🚨 Alert + Escalate\n(AlertManager)"]

    ERR --> SNAP --> JRNL --> VER
    VER -->|Valid| OK
    VER -->|Invalid| ALERT
```

Rollback does four things in order:

1. `RollbackManager.load_snapshot()` loads the most recent consistent snapshot
2. `EventJournal.replay()` replays committed journal entries since that snapshot
3. `DataValidator.validate()` checks the restored state against cryptographic checksums
4. If validation fails, an escalation alert is sent via Risk Alerts and manual intervention is needed

## Step-by-step breakdown

| Sub-flow | Trigger | Action |
|:---------|:--------|:-------|
| **6A Network** | `avg_latency > threshold` | Adaptive timeout + parallel redundant send |
| **6A Partition** | `avg_latency > 5000ms` | Trigger BFT View Change (BFT Consensus) |
| **6B Leader** | `leader_timeout` | `ConsensusRecoveryEngine.handle_leader_failure()` → View Change |
| **6B Max retries** | `recovery_attempts ≥ max` | Log critical error, alert, halt consensus |
| **6C Rollback** | Integrity failure or critical error | Snapshot → Journal replay → Validate |

---

## Error handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|:----------|:---------|
| All recovery paths exhausted (6B) | Critical alert sent, node halts consensus participation |
| Snapshot not found (6C) | Full rehydration from DB (Chain Rehydration) attempted |
| Journal replay produces invalid state (6C) | Alert escalated via Risk Alerts, manual intervention flagged |
| Network partition heals | Adaptive timeout reduces automatically, normal flow resumes |
