# WebSocket real-time streaming

## Overview

HieraChain pushes block and event notifications to connected clients over WebSocket. Clients subscribe to specific chains or event types. A background ping loop checks for stale connections and removes them.

`WebSocketManager` is a singleton (`ws_manager`) shared by all API routes, so there is a single connection registry.

## Flow diagram: connection and broadcast lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client as 🖥️ Browser / SDK Client
    participant WS as 🔌 WebSocket Endpoint
    participant WSM as 📡 WebSocketManager
    participant SC as 📦 SubChain

    Client->>WS: WebSocket Upgrade (GET /ws/{chain_name})
    WS->>WSM: connect(connection_id, websocket, chain_name)
    WSM->>WSM: Check max_connections (default 1000)
    WSM->>WSM: Registry.add(connection_id, conn)
    WSM->>WSM: SubscriptionManager.subscribe_to_chain(connection_id, chain_name)
    WS-->>Client: Connection established ✅

    opt Client subscribes to specific event types
        Client->>WS: { "action": "subscribe", "event_types": ["quality_check", ...] }
        WS->>WSM: subscribe(connection_id, chain_name, event_types)
        WSM->>WSM: SubscriptionManager.subscribe_to_event_type(...)
    end

    Note over SC: Block finalized (Event Submission step 8)

    SC->>WSM: broadcast_new_block(chain_name, block_data)
    WSM->>WSM: get_chain_subscribers(chain_name)
    loop Each subscriber
        WSM->>Client: send_text(JSON { type: "block_added", data: block_data })
    end
```

    Note over BG: Every 30 seconds

    loop Each active connection
        BG->>Client: ping frame
        alt Pong received within 10s
            Client-->>BG: pong ✅
        else Timeout (10s)
            BG->>WSM: disconnect(connection_id)

## Message format

```json
// Block added notification
{
    "type": "block_added",
    "chain": "supply_chain",
    "data": {
        "index": 42,
        "hash": "a3f8b2c1...",
        "previous_hash": "9d1e4f...",
        "timestamp": 1714000000.0,
        "event_count": 5
    }
}

// Event notification (if subscribed to event_types)
{
    "type": "event",
    "chain": "supply_chain",
    "event_type": "quality_check",
    "data": {
        "entity_id": "product-SKU-001",
        "event": "quality_check",
        "details": { "result": "passed" }
    }
}
```

## Step-by-step breakdown

| Step | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| **1. Upgrade** | HTTP GET with `Upgrade: websocket` header |
| **2. Capacity check** | Reject if `active_connections >= max_connections` (default 1000) |
| **3. Register** | `ConnectionRegistry.add()` stores connection by `connection_id` |
| **4. Subscribe** | `SubscriptionManager.subscribe_to_chain()` links connection to chain |
| **5. Optional filter** | Client can narrow to specific `event_types` |
| **6. Broadcast** | After Event Submission finalizes a block, `broadcast_new_block()` fans out to all subscribers |
| **7. Ping loop** | Background thread pings every 30s; removes unresponsive connections after 10s timeout |

---

## Error handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|:----------|:---------|
| Max connections reached | New connection refused with `1008 Policy Violation` |
| Client disconnects unexpectedly | `ConnectionRegistry.remove()` called on next send failure |
| Send to stale connection fails | Exception caught, `disconnect()` called, connection removed |
| Broadcast to empty subscriber list | No-op, no error |
