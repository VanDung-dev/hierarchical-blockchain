# Workflows overview and developer guide

HieraChain is a pure Python hierarchical ledger that works as a plugin layer for existing Web2 infrastructure. It does not replace the enterprise network stack, which already handles TLS/SSL, firewalls and WAF at the API gateway. HieraChain is focused on immutability, distributed trust, tamper evidence and non-repudiation.

This document is the central reference for 16 system workflows in 6 functional groups. It describes how they interact at runtime and how to read, maintain or add workflows.

## 1. Core development guardrails

When you work on HieraChain workflows, follow these guardrails:

* **Strict term censorship**: HieraChain tracks business process ledgers, not cryptocurrency. Do not use crypto terms in event payloads, variable names, database keys or comments.

    * Forbidden terms: `transaction`, `mining`, `coin`, `token`, `wallet`, `address`, `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, `fee`.
    * Required terms: `event` for ledger entries, `node` for peers, `msp_id` for identity, `entity_id` for domain assets.
    * Note: `CrossChainValidator` scans commits and rejects code that contains forbidden terms.

* **Minimal latency constraint**: HieraChain keeps base latency at 10 to 20ms. Keep workflow code short and fast. Do not add transport level encryption or extra wrappers that add CPU overhead.
* **No direct storage access**: Do not query SQL or Redis directly. Use storage adapters under `adapters/database/` (for example `adapters/database/sqlite_adapter.py`).

## 3. Functional groups and subsystems

Workflows are grouped into six areas. Use the dashboard to find the group that matches the subsystem you are debugging or changing:

## 4. How workflows interact

The diagram shows runtime relationships and triggers between workflows. Solid lines are synchronous or blocking operations. Dashed lines are asynchronous or event driven.

### Core developer integration paths

| Ingestion & Security Chain | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **ERP → ERP Sync → Event Submission → Proof Anchoring** | Ingestion pipeline: business change → local event → Sub-Chain block → proof hash anchored to root chain. |
| **MSP Identity → Policy Enforcement → Event Submission** | Security validation path: verify internal cert (`msp.py:verify_certificate`) → check ABAC policies → accept/reject event. |
| **Integrity Scan → Risk & Alerts → Cluster Lockdown → Error Recovery** | Anomaly detection path: `block_verifier`/`risk_analyzer` → alert dispatch → lockdown → `rollback_manager` restore. |
| **Cluster Lockdown → Key Backup** | No automatic coupling in code: key rotation/backup is manual via `cli/key.py` (not triggered by lockdown). |
| **Error Recovery → Rehydration** | State sync fallback: local snapshot validation fail triggers in-memory chain rebuild from DB journal. |

## 5. Developer guide: how to maintain workflows

Keep workflow documentation in sync with the code when you add features or fix behavior:

### Anatomy of a workflow document
Each workflow page (for example `event-submission.md`) has this layout. It must contain:

1. **Zensical front-matter**: YAML metadata with `title`, `description` and `icon`. No WF-number prefixes.
2. **Clean H1 header**: `# [Title]` that matches front-matter.
3. **Overview**: What the workflow does and when it is used.
4. **Flow diagram**: Mermaid sequence or flowchart that shows runtime interactions.
5. **Step-by-step breakdown**: Table that maps sequence numbers to developer actions.
6. **Error handling**: Table that maps failures (node offline, verification failure) to mitigations.
7. **Key classes and methods**: Pointers from workflow steps to code (for example `SubChain.add_event()`).
8. **Related**: Links to sibling or downstream workflows.

### Process for adding or modifying a workflow

1. **Write clean Markdown**: Save new flows under `docs/en/workflows/name.md` using the design system.
2. **Register in zensical.toml**: Add the workflow to the `Workflows` tree in [zensical.toml](../../zensical.toml) with a clean name.
3. **Run term scanner**: Check that no forbidden cryptocurrency vocabulary was added.
4. **Compile and verify**: Run the Zensical build in the HieraChain environment to check formatting and links:

    ```bash
    zensical build -f zensical.toml
    ```
